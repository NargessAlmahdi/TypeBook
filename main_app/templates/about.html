<h1>About TypeBook</h1>
<hr />
<p class="page-content">
    TypeBook is a personal web application designed to help designers collect, organize, and pair typefaces with ease. Users can add typefaces they discover, leave notes, rate them, and tag them by style or use case. TypeBook also makes pairing simple by letting users build their own list of clean, body-text-friendly typefaces, making it faster to find strong supporting fonts for display faces. With a focus on streamlining the design workflow, TypeBook offers a practical way to create a personalized library of type inspiration and ready-to-use font combinations.

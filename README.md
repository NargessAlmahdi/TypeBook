 # TypeBook

_TypeBook is a personal tool for designers to save and organize their favorite typefaces. Users can add fonts they find, leave notes, rate them, and tag them by style or use. It also helps with font pairing, making it easier to find the right match for any project. TypeBook is a simple way to build your own type library and stay inspired._
